# The Book Maze

## Objective
+ Build a full-stack application using a python based Django web framework that enables the user to add their favorite books along with a description about the book and why it's their favorite. 

## Motivation 
+ As an avid reader, I wanted to build an app that I would practically be using too.Sometimes you just need to rant about a book you've just read and why you really enjoyed it so this app allows you to do exactly that-a book tracker app of all your favorite books.  

## Getting Started: 
+ Click [here](https://the-book-maze.herokuapp.com/) to go to the application.
